    Women have been playing football since the 1800s. And not quietly, either. 
    
    In the early 20th century, crowds in their thousands came to watch women's games in England.
    The Dick, Kerr Ladies, founded in 1917, was one of the first recognised women's international teams.
    On Boxing Day, 1920, the team met St Helens Ladies at Everton's Goodison Park, drawing a record crowd for domestic women's football of 53,000 ‚Äî a record that stood for 99 years.


    This was a problem for the men in suits at The English Football Association. Women's football was too popular, and in terms of profit and attendance, was becoming a rival to the men's game.
    The huge sums of money being raised at women's games were outside the control and jurisdiciton of the FA, and were often being channelled towards political and working-class causes antithetical to the establishment.
    
    And there were, of course, still strong prevailing ideas about what were and were not considered suitable activities for women in the public sphere.

    On December 5, 1921, just under a year after the spectacularly successful match at Goodison Park, the FA banned women from using its grounds, effectively decimating the game. Other countries soon followed suit. 

    This chart does not represent the full list of countries in which women's football was banned, but only a small selection ‚Äî
    these nations have been chosen deliberately due to their status as traditional powerhouses in men's international football.
    Yet that success and visibility did not extend to their women‚Äôs teams, revealing a clear disparity in support, recognition, and opportunity.
