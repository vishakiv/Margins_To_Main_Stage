# From Margins to Main Stage: The Rise of Women's Football

An interactive data story on the development of international women's football

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is the creation of a visual and written narrative that shines the spotlight on the development of women's football globally, 
primary through the lens of historical World Cup Data. Through the use of socio-historical data, along with quantitative key metrics such as global 
and regional representation, team performance data and attendance figures, I aim to highlight the barriers women's football has had to overcome, the evolution 
of the game in terms of profile and competition, as well as some of the numerous inequalities that still exist in the women's footballing landscape.
