## Project Overview

The goal of this project is the creation of a visual and written narrative that shines the spotlight on the development of women's football globally, 
primary through the lens of historical World Cup Data. Through the use of socio-historical data, along with quantitative key metrics such as global 
and regional representation, team performance data and attendance figures, I aim to highlight the barriers women's football has had to overcome, the evolution 
of the game in terms of profile and competition, as well as some of the numerous inequalities that still exist in the women's footballing landscape. 

## Key Questions explored

- What historical challenges has women’s football faced?
- How global is the Women’s World Cup? How have participation rates evolved, and who has benefited most from expansion?
- Which nations have had the most success, and what insights can we gain from their success?

- What inequalities persist in women’s football at the World Cup level?
